Nice!<br><br>I hope these are blueberries.<br><br>Better than the food in the mess.<br><br>Your lips are blue.<br><br>So are yours.<br><br>In the end, the wilderness mission<br><br>wasn't a test of strength or survival<br><br>but of friendship, camaraderie, loyalty.<br><br>What are you doing?<br><br>I'm putting our mark on this place,<br>so we can remember it.<br><br>Now and forever.<br><br>- We should meet up with the others.<br>- Then what?<br><br>Someone is still gonna get left behind.<br><br>Then I find a way to get everyone home.<br><br>One of those map fragments was bogus.<br>But I'm sure this is the extraction point.<br><br>Almost a day's hike from here.<br><br>Then we better get moving.<br><br>Hold.<br><br>You guys with me. Fall out.<br><br>And keep quiet.<br><br>I heard something.<br><br>And what I find fascinating is that<br><br>even though you think<br>you've prepared for every eventuality...<br><br>They're armed<br>but they aren't in uniform.<br><br>And they don't look like soldiers.<br>Insurrectionists, maybe?<br><br>...every contingency...<br><br>So what now?<br><br>...every permutation...<br><br>Wolves.<br><br>When Deja taught us about the wolves,<br>how they hunt...<br><br>What does that...<br><br>The wolves.<br><br>...children still manage<br>to surprise you.<br><br>Wolves, children, are fierce hunters.<br><br>But while any wolf<br>can hunt and kill a rabbit,<br><br>one wolf against larger prey<br><br>can face a grisly end.<br><br>- What the...<br>- I need help! My friend is hurt!<br><br>- Go bring that girl back.<br>- Yes, sir.<br><br>But when wolves hunt in a pack...<br><br>- Where's the girl?<br>- I think I broke my leg.<br><br>Oh, I got your broken leg<br>right here, kid.<br><br>...they take down larger prey with ease.<br><br>What the hell, Vince?<br><br>One little girl<br>too much for you to handle?<br><br>Ah, Doctor.<br><br>Trainee 117 was just explaining<br>why he attacked and injured UNSC soldiers.<br><br>And why he stole the property<br>they were left to guard.<br><br>Ma'am, the craft was UNSC,<br><br>but the men in the force were hostile<br>and were not in regulation uniform.<br><br>- You flew home?<br>- Not exactly.<br><br>I rigged the autopilot<br>to return to base, ma'am.<br><br>And you brought them all home?<br><br>According to orders, last trainee<br>to the ship was supposed to walk.<br><br>Instead, we stuck together,<br>like the Spartans at Thermopylae.<br><br>In the real ending of the story, 117,<br><br>the Spartans are betrayed<br>and slaughtered.<br><br>It is their sacrifice<br>that actually saves and unites Greece.<br><br>But we had more choices.<br><br>The men you hit with rocks didn't.<br><br>No, sir, they did not.<br><br>So, Doctor, what do we do with this one?<br><br>Well, Mendez,<br>I suggest a promotion to Squad Leader.<br><br>Thank you, sir.<br><br>What is the highest rank I can attain?<br><br>As a non-commissioned officer, 117,<br><br>the highest rank you can attain<br>is Master Chief Petty Officer.<br><br>Then I will.<br><br>Perhaps you will at that,<br><br>but your next mission won't be so easy.<br><br>And there will be casualties.<br><br>What is that mission, sir?<br><br>Your mission, John,<br><br>is to survive.<br><br>Samuel-034, Blue Team mission report.<br><br>I don't remember the operation,<br><br>but when we awoke,<br>we were something new.<br><br>Unbreakable materials<br>grafted to our bones, gene therapy.<br><br>Muscle density increased,<br>enhanced skeletal and muscular growth.<br><br>Of course,<br><br>we had no clue<br>what we had to live through first.<br><br>Replay the message, Deja.<br><br>Message from Admiral Ysionris Jeromi.<br><br>Chief Medical Officer,<br>research station Hopeful.<br><br>Catherine, I wish I had better news.<br><br>Further analysis<br>has yielded zero alternatives<br><br>to mitigate the risks in your proposed<br>hypothetical experimentation.<br><br>But I understand<br>the theoretical framework, Catherine,<br><br>and admire the imagination.<br><br>But I hope it is<br>in fact a hypothetical study<br><br>Details are in the attached files.<br><br>But your proposed treatments<br>could result in any of the following,<br><br>cell necrosis, stroke,<br>cardiovascular failure<br><br>and even Fletcher syndrome.<br><br>You proposed the use of lab animals,<br>simian proxies, in your tests.<br><br>I must be blunt.<br><br>I cannot imagine any more than half<br>of the subjects surviving this process.<br><br>I would hate to see<br>the poor creatures destroyed<br><br>in some Section III project, Dr. Halsey.<br><br>Well, I've said my piece.<br><br>Best of luck to you, Catherine.<br><br>Doctor, augmentation was always<br>a vital but statistically dangerous stage.<br><br>How many?<br><br>ONI was promised soldiers,<br><br>and you were the only mind<br>that could accomplish it.<br><br>How many dead, Deja?<br><br>27 deceased.<br><br>36% of the candidates.<br><br>Children.<br><br>36% of the children.<br><br>The subjects are just<br>one-half of the equation, Doctor.<br><br>Both MJOLNIR and the cognitive impression<br>modeling are critical.<br><br>You're correct.<br><br>- Doctor?<br>- This is our only option.<br><br>Every day the Insurrection invents<br>new acts of terror<br><br>to pull humanity farther into the muck.<br><br>Our civilization is balanced<br>on a razor's edge,<br><br>and the insurgents threaten<br>to bring it down around our ears.<br><br>If even one candidate survives<br>and balance is restored,<br><br>history will absolve me<br>for the greater good.<br><br>Duty.<br><br>Honor.<br><br>Self-sacrifice.<br><br>We were 14 when we lost almost half<br>of our comrades to augmentation failures.<br><br>Death does not diminish<br>these qualities in a soldier.<br><br>We shall remember our dead.<br><br>Honors, attention!<br><br>Kids I grew up with,<br>never said goodbye to.<br><br>We commit the bodies of our fallen<br>to space.<br><br>I still remember their names.<br><br>The deaths affected<br>each of us differently<br><br>Fire teams came and went,<br>but core loyalties and friendships endure.<br><br>Even beyond death.<br><br>Of course, it didn't sit well with John.<br><br>Where are you taking my men?<br><br>Let 'em go, Squad Leader.<br><br>They can't fight anymore.<br><br>They don't belong here.<br><br>What happens to them?<br><br>The Navy takes care of its own.<br><br>Their minds are still sharp.<br><br>And our war effort can always<br>use soldiers for less physical duties.<br><br>John never left anyone behind.<br><br>Not if he could help it.<br><br>Was there something else, son?<br><br>Sir, I'm Squad Leader.<br>Members of my unit died.<br><br>What should I have done<br>to keep that from happening?<br><br>117.<br><br>John.<br><br>What your class went through,<br><br>that any of you survived at all<br>is a testament to your strength.<br><br>Walk with me.<br><br>A leader must be ready to send the men<br>under his command to their deaths.<br><br>Your duty is to the mission.<br><br>I'm sorry, sir, but I fail to see<br>how that applies to this situation.<br><br>The lesson is sacrifice.<br><br>It is acceptable to spend lives<br>when necessary, Squad Leader.<br><br>What is not acceptable<br>is to waste said lives.<br><br>Which was this, sir? Spent or wasted?<br><br>Get some rest, Squad Leader.<br><br>- What did Mendez say?<br>- Not much.<br><br>Let me guess.<br><br>Something about duty and sucking it up.<br><br>That sounds nothing like him.<br><br>Like your owl.<br><br>It sounds exactly like him.<br><br>Me and Kels are going<br>to the shooting range later. You in?<br><br>No. I'm going to hit the gym.<br><br>John was still processing our losses.<br><br>Emotionally and physically<br><br>For weeks after augmentation,<br>every bone in our bodies ached.<br><br>Our eyes throbbed and bled.<br><br>We got headaches.<br><br>Fell down.<br><br>Clumsy in our new skins.<br><br>Dr. Halsey told us our brains<br>would have to relearn<br><br>how to work with our new bodies.<br><br>Learn how to use new strength and speed.<br><br>But it wasn't easy.<br><br>And it was frustrating.<br><br>The thing about John is that<br><br>he really only knew 3 ways<br>to react to people.<br><br>If you were his superior officer,<br>he obeyed you.<br><br>If you were in his squad,<br>he would die for you.<br><br>But if you were a threat?<br><br>Then God help you.<br><br>Heart rate steady.
